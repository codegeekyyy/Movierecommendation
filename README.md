ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
A simple and effective content-based movie recommendation system built with Python. It suggests movies similar to a user's favorite by analyzing the plot descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. This system is perfect for learning about natural language processing (NLP), vector space models, and basic recommendation engine techniques.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses the plot/overview of movies as textual data. The core idea is to recommend movies that have a similar narrative or theme to the one the user likes. This is achieved by converting text to numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) and then computing cosine similarity between these vectors.
